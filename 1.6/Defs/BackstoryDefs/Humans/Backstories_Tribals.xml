Leaving the scarred survivors behind.\n[PAWN_nameDef] still experiences night terrors from seeing [PAWN_possessive] friends and family suspended in the vats.</description>

    <description>The village elder of [PAWN_nameDef]s tribe was seen as a great blood machine, imprisoned in the form of a human, and cast down by the Gods for going against their will. But it was really just a mechanent that found its way into the tribe generations prior. [PAWN_nameDef]s job was to occasionally milk the boomalope herd to gain "liquid fire" to fuel [PAWN_possessive] elders reactor.</description>

    <description>[PAWN_nameDef] spent the majority of [PAWN_possessive] adulthood training to hunt and kill the "great blood machines" to protect [PAWN_possessive] tribe - [PAWN_pronoun] learned that arrows and daggers couldn't kill them; but a well laid ambush, and a lump of uranium slotted into a stone club definitely could.</description>
